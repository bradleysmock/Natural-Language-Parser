Welcome to Bradley's Natural Language Parser!

Instructions

Prior to running the parser, please be sure that you have a Python 3.x interpreter and the NLTK installed on your system. If you do not, please refer to the following websites for the correct installation instructions for your system:
www.python.org
www.nltk.org

Once Python and NLTK are installed, go to the command line (e.g. in Terminal).

At the command line, navigate to the folder containing the project files.

Open the project by typing the Python command followed by runparser.py, e.g.:
    python3 runparser.py

The project menu will present you with four options for parsing and one to exit the program:
    Parse Text to Screen: Manually enter some text and display the parsed text on the screen.
    Parse Text to File: Manually enter some text and save the parsed text in a file.
    Parse File to Screen: Read text from a file and display the parsed text on the screen.
    Parse File to File: Read text from a file and save the parsed text in a file.

Choose your desired menu option by entering the corresponding number.

If you chose to manually enter some text:
    Type the text in at the prompt.
    Use || to designate the separation between paragraphs.
    Press enter when finished.

If you chose to read text from a file:
    Enter the file path and name, including the extension, of the file containing the text you wish to parse when prompted.

If you chose to save the parsed text to a file:
    Enter the file path and name, including the extension, of the file in which you wish to save the parsed text when prompted.

After the results are displayed, press enter to return to the menu.

Notice that the parser displays any errors it had, e.g. it couldnâ€™t find the word type, on screen during the parsing.
